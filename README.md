# Product Builder for Elite Drip

This project is an extension of the Elit Drip Data Pipelines repository. To facilitate the creation of new products within the Elite Drip database, I developed a Python-based API that leverages OpenAI's capabilities. The API has a single endpoint: create_new_product, which automates the generation of a new product.

The API is deployed on Google Cloud Run, making it accessible and scalable.

For security reasons, Iâ€™m unable to share the endpoint URL. But, here is the response format

```json

  "category": "Pants",
  "created_at": "Fri, 30 Aug 2024 17:32:57 GMT",
  "gender": "F",
  "title": "Court Queen Performance Joggers",
  "unit_amount": 150,

}
