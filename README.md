# Product Builder

This project is an extension of the Elit Drip Data Pipelines repository. To facilitate the creation of new products within the Elite Drip database, I developed a Python-based API that leverages OpenAI's capabilities. The API has a single endpoint: create_new_product, which automates the generation of a new product.

The API is deployed on Google Cloud Run, making it accessible and scalable.

You can generate a new product by clicking on this [endpoint](https://product-builder-main-883192161608.us-central1.run.app/get_new_product).
